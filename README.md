# Todo

This is pretty much what happens after "Hello World". One builds a todo-app.

## Full disclosure

This project was built using (Haskell Stack)[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/] because I read somewhere that it was the recommended approach. I have no idea (yet) what most of these autogenerated files do. The code I have written can be found in `app/Main.hs`.

# Usage

You need to have (Haskell Stack)[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/] installed.
```
stack build
```

This will build the project. To run the application:
(Currently the app expects the file `~/.todo` to exist, so make sure it exists)

```
stack exec todo-exe help
```

This will display all the available commands:

```
add 	Add an item
check	Mark an item as completed
purge	Remove all completed items
clear	Remove all items
help	You're looking at it
```


So there. I made something.
